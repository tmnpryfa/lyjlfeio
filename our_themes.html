		<h3 class="title">With the freedom of entrepreneurship, i.e.  3.  But</h3>
		<p>But the main thing is that we have many different ways of thinking at our disposal, and we are not using our potential.  As an adherent of the Quadrant II paradigm, you realize that most of the R-activity is in Quadrant I, and most of the PC-activity is in Quadrant II.  Most of us know from our own experience how unreliable such a center is, since it is subject to many forces and can quickly disappear.  By the time I die, I want to use my potential completely, without a trace.  Developing our skills, changing our ways of influencing, and changing our attitude to problems out of control are all within the Circle of Influence.Expanding the Circle of Influence Inspires the realization that by choosing our response to circumstances, we seriously influence the circumstances themselves.  Change comes from the roots - from your way of thinking, from your fundamental, foundational paradigms that define your character and create the lens through which you look at the world.  State innovation policy measures should include stimulating competition, informatization of society,standardization and certification of products and services.  Synergy in the classroom As a teacher, I have come to believe that many of the truly successful lessons or workshops are teetering on the very edge of chaos.  I realized that we must carefully look not only at the world around us, but also at the "prism" through which we look, and that this "prism" itself determines our perception of the world.  Moreover, each firm seeks to obtain the greatest possible profit from its activities.  At first, I just asked her to carefully select the frames for shooting, because there was not much film left. </p>

		<p>When people seriously think about what is really important to them, what they want to be and what to do, they begin to take life more seriously.  If the machine is replaced with a new, more progressive one, a renovation has taken place.  Then I asked them a question: Which of the three disadvantages would you attribute to yourself more - (1) inability to prioritize; (2) an inability or unwillingness to organize oneself based on these priorities; (3) lack of discipline to act on those priorities, to stay organized and stay true to your priorities? Most people consider indiscipline to be their main drawback.  4.  Tell me, could you dine with the two of us to watch us talk to each other? - Well, please! - I agreed.  If two people who are married are more concerned about getting the golden eggs for themselves than about maintaining those relationships that make this possible, they often become insensitive and inattentive, neglect the acts of kindness and signs of attention that are so necessary to create deep relationships. </p>

		<p>And if you go down this path, focus on your Circle of Influence, you will really really begin to understand others.  We can be happy and take for granted what is beyond our control, while focusing our efforts on what is in our power.The Other End of the Stick Before we completely shift the "center of gravity" of our life into the Circle of Influence, there are two things to consider from our Circle of Concern that deserve serious attention.  The mall managers have parted ways with police or bystander roles.  Our PCs are at the center of our Circle of Influence, and no one but us can ensure their development.We must try for ourselves.  I can feel the material covering the chair I will be sitting on, I can feel the floor under my feet and the sweater I am wearing.  And expectations (as well as satisfaction) are in our Circle of Influence.  Land rent is the central economic category governing the economic relationship between the landowner and the entrepreneur who leases land for farming on a capitalist basis. </p>
